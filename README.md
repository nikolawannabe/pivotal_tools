-------

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikolawannabe/pivotal_tools/
cd pivotal_tools

```


setup

Add PIVOTAL_TOKEN to your environment

I put mine in ~/.bash_aliases, like so ...

Also make sure in your pivotal project settings that you have "Allow API Access" checked (which is currently the default behavior)
